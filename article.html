            <p>University Esports in Kenya is about to get even more exciting. Tunza Esports has confirmed the return of the Kenya University Esports Rankings (KUER) for Season 3, and this time the competition comes with a brand-new structure.</p>
            <p>For the first time, KUER will run in two separate periods. The first kicks off in September 2025 while the second follows in January 2026. This change allows more gaming titles to be included and ensures that Kenya University Sports in Kenya stays active throughout the academic year.</p>
            <p><strong>Titles in the First Period</strong></p>
            <p>The September season will feature Free Fire, Bloodstrike, FC 25 (2v2), Chess, PUBG Mobile, and eFootball.</p>
            <p><strong>Titles in the Second Period</strong></p>
            <p>In January, KUER will continue with Call of Duty Mobile Multiplayer, Valorant 5v5, Tekken 8, Mortal Kombat, Rocket League, FC 25 in the 1v1 format, and NBA 2K26. This mix of shooters, fighters, and sports titles adds depth and variety to the season.</p>
            <p><strong>Why Season 3 Matters</strong></p>
            <p>KUER has already established itself as the leading platform for University Esports in Kenya. Season 3 strengthens that reputation by providing more opportunities for students to compete, represent their universities, and showcase their talent. For the growing community of Esports in Kenya, this new format ensures nonstop action and greater inclusion of different gaming genres.</p>
            <p><strong>The Future of Kenya Esports</strong></p>
            <p>Season 3 is more than a tournament. It is a statement about the growth of competitive gaming in Kenya. With more titles, a two-period structure, and wider participation, KUER continues to raise the standard for University Esports and Kenya Esports as a whole.</p>
